**Fixed**

- The connection was incorrectly shown as successful for proxy connections when nginx was running, but the Polis daemon was not.

- Added a new "public" RPC node: suzy.polis-masternode-tool.org:443.

- *"QThread: Destroyed while thread is still runningAborted (core dumped)"* occurs under Linux in rare cases. If you encounter this error, try running the application several times. If that does not help, please contact the author.
